# RL-Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to implement several reinforcement learning algorithms. They are
presented below:

- Value-based methods
    - [x] ~~Deep Q-Networks~~
    - [x] ~~Dueling DQN~~
    - [x] ~~Double Q-Learning~~
    - [ ] Prioritized Experience Replay
    - [ ] Multi-step DQN
    - [ ] Noisy DQN
    - [ ] Distributional RL
- Policy-based methods

# Installation

I've only tried building this project on Linux machines.

## Linux(Debian-based systems)

```shell
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rlalgs
```

# Usage

I will include some samples as soon as I get more algorithms implemented.
