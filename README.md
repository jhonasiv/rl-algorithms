# RL-Algorithms

This project aims to provide an API for reinforcement learning algorithms.
For now, this is only a small project I am working on to improve my knowledge about these reinforcement learning 
algorithms.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to implement several reinforcement learning algorithms.
They are presented below:

- Value-based methods
    - [x] ~~Deep Q-Networks~~
    - [x] ~~Dueling DQN~~
    - [x] ~~Double Q-Learning~~
    - [x] ~~Prioritized Experience Replay~~
    - [ ] Multi-step DQN
    - [ ] Noisy DQN
    - [ ] Distributional RL
- Policy-based methods


# Installation

I've built this project only on Linux machines for now.

## Linux(Debian-based systems)

```shell
# Clone this repository
